# MatlabZombiesBasics

Code for a simple zombie-themed game with Matlab.

## Starting the game

Open a Matlab instance, and run 
```matlab
>>> zombie_game
```

## Instructions:

Use arrow keys to move Rick. Use space bar to shoot. You can shoot only one bullet at the time. 

## How the game works

The zombie moves up and down on the screen. Rick Grimes can move in any direction, and can shoot. The objective is to shoot the zombie in the head and kill it. If the zombie touches Rick, then Rick dies and the game is over.
